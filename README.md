# Basics

## Getting the repo

To clone the repo, do the following:

```
  git clone git@github.com:jonroberts/rater.git
```
I've set both of you up as users, so that should work. If you want to set up an ssh key (so you don't have to provide a password for every pull/push request) then [follow this](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) and send me the public key. I'll get that added in.
